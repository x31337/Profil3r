# Get Access Token from Cookies

**Script:** `fb-cookies-to-get-access-token.php`

This tool attempts to extract a Facebook access token from a given set of browser cookies for facebook.com.

## How to Use via Web UI

*(Note: The following is a general guideline, as this tool's UI integration status is not fully detailed. Specific fields and steps might vary. This method is highly dependent on Facebook's internal authentication mechanisms and may be unreliable or require specific cookie formats.)*

1.  **Navigate to the Tool:**
    *   On the main page of the PHP Facebook Tools Web App, locate and select the "Get Access Token from Cookies" tool (or a similar name).

2.  **Input Cookies:**
    *   The UI will provide a text area or input field where you can paste the Facebook cookies.
    *   These cookies should typically be in a format recognized by the script (e.g., JSON, Netscape cookie format, or a simple string of `name=value` pairs). The UI should specify the expected format if possible.

3.  **Submit:**
    *   Click the "Get Token", "Extract Token", or a similarly labeled button.

## Inputs Required

*   **Facebook Cookies:** A string or structured representation of the browser cookies for `facebook.com` associated with an active session.

## Expected Output

*   **Success:** If an access token can be extracted, the UI will display the token. It might also provide options to copy the token.
*   **Failure:** An error message indicating that an access token could not be extracted. This could be due to:
    *   Invalid or expired cookies.
    *   Incorrect cookie format.
    *   Changes in Facebook's authentication flow that the script cannot handle.
    *   The cookies not containing the necessary information to derive a token.

## Notes

*   **Security Risk:** Handling cookies, especially for authentication, is a significant security risk. Ensure you trust the application and the environment where you are inputting these cookies. Cookies can grant full access to your Facebook account.
*   **Reliability:** This method is prone to breakages as Facebook updates its platform. Official OAuth 2.0 flows are the recommended way to obtain access tokens.
*   **Cookie Format:** The success of this tool heavily depends on the `fb-cookies-to-get-access-token.php` script's ability to parse the provided cookie string and the specific cookies Facebook uses at any given time to represent an authenticated session from which a token can be derived.
*   Use this tool with extreme caution and only with cookies you have obtained legitimately and understand the implications of sharing.
