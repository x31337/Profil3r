# Register Facebook Account

**Script:** `reg-fb-acc.php`

This tool is designed to automate the process of registering a new Facebook account.

## How to Use via Web UI

_(Note: The following is a general guideline, as this tool's UI integration status is not fully detailed. Specific fields and steps might vary. Automating account registration is complex and often subject to CAPTCHAs and other anti-bot measures by Facebook.)_

1.  **Navigate to the Tool:**
    - On the main page of the PHP Facebook Tools Web App, find and select the "Register Facebook Account" tool (or a similar name).

2.  **Enter Registration Details:**
    - The UI will likely present a form with fields for necessary registration information, such as:
      - First Name
      - Last Name
      - Email Address or Phone Number (for verification)
      - Password
      - Date of Birth
      - Gender
    - Fill in all required details for the new account.

3.  **Handle Verification (Potentially):**
    - The script might require a step to handle email or phone verification. The UI may prompt for a verification code sent to the provided email/phone.
    - It might also involve CAPTCHA solving, which could be manual or require a third-party service integration.

4.  **Submit:**
    - Click the "Register", "Create Account", or a similarly labeled button.

## Inputs Required

- **Registration Information:** All details required by Facebook for account creation (name, email/phone, password, DOB, gender).
- **Verification Codes (if applicable):** Codes sent to email or phone.
- **CAPTCHA solutions (if applicable).**

## Expected Output

- **Success:** A confirmation message indicating that the account has been successfully registered. It might provide some details of the new account.
- **Failure:** An error message detailing why the registration failed. Common reasons include:
  - Information already in use (email, phone).
  - Weak password.
  - Facebook's anti-fraud systems blocking the registration.
  - CAPTCHA failure.
  - Incomplete or invalid information.
  - Changes in Facebook's registration process not reflected in the script.

## Notes

- **Facebook's Terms of Service:** Automating account creation is often against Facebook's Terms of Service. Accounts created this way may be quickly flagged or disabled. Use with extreme caution and responsibility.
- **Reliability:** This is a very sensitive script. Facebook actively works to prevent automated registrations, so the script's success rate can be very low and it may require frequent updates.
- **Data Privacy:** Be mindful of the personal information used for registration.
- The `reg-fb-acc.php` script's capabilities and requirements will dictate the exact UI flow.
